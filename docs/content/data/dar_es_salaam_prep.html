<p>This notebook builds a dataset for Dar Es Salaam (Tanzania) describing the built environment. Two main aspects are considered: the street network and buildings. To capture those, the following variables are calculated at for the H3 hexagonal grid system, zoom level 8:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Building density: number of buildings per hexagon</p></li>
<li><p>Building coverage: proportion of the hexagon covered by buildings</p></li>
<li><p>Street length: total length of streets within the hexagon</p></li>
<li><p>Street linearity: a measure of how regular the street network is</p></li>
